**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

* Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable require intentional planning before development begins. I ensure my programs follow these standards through considering the entire scope of the project before development or structure planning even begins. Working on the Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) Module in this project is a great example of working with the future use in mind. In project one, I developed a Python CRUD module ensuring that it was versatile with these values in mind. I ensured that each of these CRUD functions accepted a wide range of inputs and allowed for specifics outside of the CRUD module, essentially not limiting the use inside of the CRUD module itself. Keeping the CRUD module basic allows for flexibility in how other scripts may access this CRUD module.

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses?**

* When I approach a problem as a computer scientist I consider every step I need to take to solve the problem. For example, if I need to add a feature to a program that changes volume when a button is hit I would break this into tiny steps. Firstly we need to know when a user hits a specific button, which I would then break down further into things like, "How do I track whether that button is pressed?" and "Do I need to know how long they press the button for?" Breaking problems down into steps like these has saved me future-me a lot of headaches in going back to address use cases I hadn't thought of originally. In the case of this project and implementing a webpage dashboard with Python, Jupyter, and Dash it was challenging. Rather than starting at the root of the problem solving, we were given starter code that I had to study and understand so I could add compatible code onto the already written code. Some of the initial questions I would have asked had already been solved, leaving me asking "If I were a user of this site, what features would I want?" This led me to implement filtering and pagination with the user in mind.

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

* Computer Scientists 'do' a huge range of things in many different positions. If we boil down the functions of a Computer Scientist to the most basic form, I would suggest simply that they, 'use technology to solve problems'. The technologies and the issues can vary drastically, but overall the task of a Computer Scientist is to use their technical expertise to solve real life problems. They are extremely important to our modern world as nearly everything we use daily is considered technology. As technlogy continues to advance, it is crucial for society to have individuals who understand how this technology works. Understanding these new technologies allow for them to continue improving, and also allow for problem solving of current issues. Computer Scientists are important in the same way mechanics are important. They both hold expertise in their fields, allowing for complex problem solving where a common individual likely couldn't.
